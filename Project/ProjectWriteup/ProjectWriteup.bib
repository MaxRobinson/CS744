abstract = "N-gram based indexing technique has been proved as a useful technique for efficient document retrieval. We applied the n-gram approach and performed experiments in Hindi language text collections. The experiments are performed on the dataset of FIRE 2010 Hindi text collections. We used the Terrier open search engine for experimental purpose. Our experiments state that 4-gram gives the best results among all n-grams of different length. The results show an increase in value of mean average precision."

pages="73--97",
abstract="The Cross-Language Evaluation Forum has encouraged research in text retrieval methods for numerous European languages and has developed durable test suites that allow language-specific techniques to be investigated and compared. The labor associated with crafting a retrieval system that takes advantage of sophisticated linguistic methods is daunting. We examine whether language-neutral methods can achieve accuracy comparable to language-specific methods with less concomitant software complexity. Using the CLEF 2002 test set we demonstrate empirically how overlapping character n-gram tokenization can provide retrieval accuracy that rivals the best current language-specific approaches for European languages. We show that n = 4 is a good choice for those languages, and document the increased storage and time requirements of the technique. We report on the benefits of and challenges posed by n-grams, and explain peculiarities attendant to bilingual retrieval. Our findings demonstrate clearly that accuracy using n-gram indexing rivals or exceeds accuracy using unnormalized words, for both monolingual and bilingual retrieval.",
